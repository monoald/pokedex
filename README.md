Pokédex built with the [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2), it shows every Pokémon by region, and every move on the games.  Also, you can **filter** both **by type**. You can see the project deployed [here](https://monoald.github.io/pokedex/).

## Pokémon Info

On the Pokédex page you will see a bunch of Pokémon cards, if you click on one of them the info of the selected Pokémon will appear, it contains basic info such as the Pokémon description, stats, abilities and a section with the evolution stages that will redirect to the selected Pokémon if you click on one of them.

### Knowledge

Making this project, I use new knowledge acquired from [Platzi](https://platzi.com/). I use asynchronous functions, creating my on fetchData function with promises that later I replace with the native fetch function to use its abort functionality. Work with request is a new “level” for me, there are some things that I had to make on a different way  to make my code work, like use async and await. Also, I battled with the relative links to make my page work on GitHub Pages, and that is something I’ll never forget.
